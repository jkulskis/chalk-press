# Chalk Press

Chalk.press is an interdisciplinary multifaceted collaborative emphatic trilingual collective which engages in
assiduous textile-based exigent operations across a variety of efflorescent spheres, ambits, and perimetrices,
constantly pursuing effective material-centric solutions to a plethora of quagmires via the simultaneous
recontextualization and reconvenctionalization of transgressive looping.
Items are sewn, embroidered, dyed, and printed by hand. Blanks are either upcycled or sourced from domestic,
unionized, producers. Dyes are ecologically derived from foraged plants and metals.

Because of the handmade nature of our products, slight differentiation may occur. Plz don’t freak out!
